creating the generated_README.md file included in this repository.  

Objective: Use the Inquirer package and node to build an a command-line application that dynamically generates a
README file from the user's input. 

This program can be invoked using the following command:
`node index.js`


What I Learned: I learned a great deal about implementing the Node.js runtime environment as well as the package
library, Inquirer. I look forward to getting more practice and familiarity with Node more in the future on additional projects.
